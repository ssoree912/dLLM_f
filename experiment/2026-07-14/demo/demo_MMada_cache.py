He gave 2/5 of the amount to his wife, 2/5 of the remaining amount to his first son, 40% of the remaining amount to his second son, and kept the remaining in their family savings account. Calculate the total amount he kept in the family's savings account.\nAnswer: The total amount of money Mr. Eithan gave to his wife is 2/5*2000 = $<<2/5*2000=800>>800\nAfter giving his wife $800, he remained with $2000-$800=$<<2000-800=1200>>1200\nHe gave his first son 2/5 of the remaining amount which is 2/5*$1200 = $<<2/5*1200=480>>480\nThe total amount remaining after he gave his first 2/5 of the amount is $1200-$480 = $<<1200-480=720>>720\nHe then gave his second son 40/100*720 = $<<40/100*720=288>>288 of the money.\nAfter giving his second son $288, the amount of money remaining that he saved in the family's saving account is $720-$288=$432\n#### 432\n\nQuestion: Roosevelt High school plays a basketball tournament with Greendale High school. Roosevelt high school scores 30 points in the first game, half as much in the second game, and triple as much as the second game in the third game. At the end of the tournament, Roosevelt high school receives 50 bonus points and Greendale high school has 10 points less than Roosevelt high school. How many points does Greendale high school have?\nAnswer: The points Roosevelt high school has for the second game are 30/2=<<30/2=15>>15 points.\nThe points Roosevelt high school has for the third game are 15*3=<<15*3=45>>45 points.\nThe total points Roosevelt high school has for the tournament are 30+15+45+50=<<30+15+45+50=140>>140 points.\nThe total points Greendale high school has for the tournament are 140-10=<<140-10=130>>130 points.\n#### 130\n\nQuestion: On Tuesday, a fruit vendor sold 2.5 dozen lemons and 5 dozens avocados. What is the total number of fruits that the fruit vendor sold?\nAnswer: Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, then the vendor sold 2.5 x 12 = <<2.5*12=30>>30 lemons.\nWhile he sold 5 x 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 avocados.\nSo, the fruit vendor sold a total of 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 fruits.\n#### 90\n\nQuestion: Sandra wants to buy some sweets. She saved $10 for this purpose. Her mother gave her an additional $4, and her father twice as much as her mother. One candy costs $0.5, and one jelly bean $0.2. She wants to buy 14 candies and 20 jelly beans. How much money will she be left with after the purchase?\nAnswer: Sandra's father gave her $4 * 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8.\nSo Sandra has in total $8 + $4 + $10 = $<<8+4+10=22>>22.\nShe wants 14 candies, so she is going to pay 14 candies * $0.50/candy = $<<14*0.5=7>>7 for them.\nShe wants also 20 jellybeans, and they're going to cost 20 jellybeans * $0.20/jellybean = $<<20*0.2=4>>4.\nSo after the purchase, she will be left with $22 - $4 - $7 = $<<22-4-7=11>>11.\n#### 11\n\nQuestion: Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden.
